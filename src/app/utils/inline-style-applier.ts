 * This class is necessary because when copying HTML to the clipboard, styles must be applied as inline styles manually.
 * Otherwise, they won't have any effect. This process is not done automatically due to performance reasons — assigning all
 * inline styles to all elements would create a significant overhead. Instead, we manually apply only the essential styles,
 * primarily font-related ones such as font-family and color, while stripping away all others.
 *
 * Additionally, since some text nodes have been converted into span nodes (which would typically inherit properties from
 * their parent), we store the root styles (i.e., styles of the root element) and apply them to these converted text nodes.
 * This ensures that text appearance remains consistent even after transformation.
