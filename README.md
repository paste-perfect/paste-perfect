## Features

- **Seamless Copy** – Retain syntax highlighting and indentation when copying to Word or PowerPoint.
- **Persistence** – Settings (language, theme, indentation, etc.) are remembered between sessions.
- **Dynamic Loading** – Only load the Prism.js language definitions you actually need.
- **Support for Different Indentation Modes** – Choose spaces, tabs, or non-breaking spaces (NBSP), depending on your target application.

## Usage

1. **Enter Your Code** → Paste or type your code in the **Source Code** section.
2. **Adjust Settings** → Select:
   - **Language** (e.g., TypeScript, Python, C++)
   - **Theme** (various color schemes)
   - **Indentation Mode**:
     - **Spaces/Tabs** → Best for Word
     - **NBSP** → Best for PowerPoint
   - **Indentation Size**
3. **View the Highlighted Output** → The formatted code appears in the **Result** section.
4. **Copy with Formatting** → Click the green **Copy** button to copy your code with inline styling.
5. **Auto-Save Preferences** → Settings persist, so you don’t need to reconfigure them next time.

## Project Background

I had the experience that most online syntax highlighters lose their formatting or indentation when pasted into Microsoft Word or PowerPoint. Either:

- **No styling** is preserved,
- **Indentation** is completely lost, or
- Other formatting issues occur.

**Paste Perfect** solves this by:

- **Inlining styles** before copying.
- **Replacing leading spaces/tabs with appropriate characters** to ensure indentation stays intact.
- **Allowing customization for different applications** (Word, PowerPoint, etc.).
